A Component is one of the core building blocks of React. They have the same purpose as JavaScript functions and return HTML. 
Components make the task of building UI much easier. A UI is broken down into multiple individual pieces called components. 
You can work on components independently and then merge them all into a parent component which will be your final UI.
